## Build Environment

In order to make learning easy and simple while going through `Mastering Servuce Mesh Architecture` book, it is recommended that you have a development environment ready to practice.

Consult this guide to build your development environment using a single VM running on either  Windows Laptop or Apple MacBook: [https://github.com/servicemeshistio/icpvm](https://github.com/servicemeshistio/icpvm). This environment is recommended and suitable for most developers.

However, if you want to build a multi-node Kubernetes cluster, consult this [https://github.com/servicemeshistio/icp](https://github.com/servicemeshistio/icp). You will be able to build an enterprise like multi-node Kubernetes environment using free IBM Cloud Private Community edition.
